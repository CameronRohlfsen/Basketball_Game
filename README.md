# Basketball Game
The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by shooting a basketball into the hoop. The game is played between two players (multiplayer) or a single player against an empty hoop (single player mode). 

- The game is won when the first player reaches a score of 15 points.
- Points are earned by successfully shooting the ball into the hoop. Every successful shot counts as 1 point.
- Players can also miss shots, and the game will continue until one player wins or quits.

Game Overview:
- Player 1 (or Player 2 in multiplayer) controls their respective player using the keyboard.
- The hoop moves back and forth across the screen, and you need to time your shot to make sure the ball goes through the hoop.
- In single-player mode, Player 2's score is disabled and only Player 1 plays against the hoop.
- In multiplayer mode, both players compete to score the most points. Points only count if they score in their assigned hoop.

How to Play:
   - Player 1: Use the `A` key to move left, the `D` key to move right, and the ‘W’ key to shoot the ball.
   - Player 2: Use the `J` key to move left and the `L` key to move right, and the ‘I’ key to shoot the ball. 
   - When the ball goes through the hoop, the player earns 1 point and the hoop size decreases (making it harder to score with each successful shot) for the first 8 points, then remains the same size until the end of the game.
   - If a shot is missed, no points are awarded, and the ball resets to the player's starting position.
   - The game will automatically end when a player reaches **15 points**.
   - The game will display "End of Game" with the final score once a player wins.
   - Press the `Q` key at any time to quit the game.

Prerequisites:
   - You need to have the gfx library installed to run this game.
